  There are three vendors of HPC-grade GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD,
  Intel), and many different programming models to use the
  devices for general computing. It's a zoo! The overview
  presents the status of the possible combinations of some
  more established programming models, given comments and
  details for every combination. The repository contains the
  YAML raw data and scripts and templates to generate tables
  (HTML, PDF via LaTeX (also SVG from PDF)).
