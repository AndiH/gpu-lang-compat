abstract="While heterogeneous computing has emerged as a dominant trend in current and future High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, it is also widely recognized that this shift has led to increased software complexity due to a proliferation of programming systems for different heterogeneous processors. One such example is the Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability from AMD (HIP), which is composed of a C Runtime API and C++ Kernel Language. Many HPC applications will likely use HIP on future exascale systems (e.g., Frontier and El Capitan), but HIP currently only targets AMD and NVIDIA processors. This limitation creates challenges for users who would also like to run their applications on exascale systems based on other architectures (e.g., Aurora, which is based on Intel hardware) that are currently not targeted by HIP.",
